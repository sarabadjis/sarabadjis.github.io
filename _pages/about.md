## Professional

I am a health geographer, demographer and statistical data science. With a focus on applied statistical methods,
I research how health and disease attainment vary by cumulative environmental and social exposures, including wildfire
evacuation orders and extreme weather events. I use a host of different data sources including electronic medical
record data, person-generated health data from wearable technologies, and earth observation products.
I use a range of statistical methods in my analyses including hazard models, statistical machine learning, and
methods for modeling correlated longitudinal data.

Recently, I have joined the Implementation Science and Population Health program at the City University of New York
 as a Postdoctoral Fellow assessing impacts of climate change on health outcomes and access to care for people living
with HIV. I am also a fellow in the University of California Center for Climate Health Equity.
