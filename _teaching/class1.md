I developed a "Math-Stat Bootcamp" refresher course that is offered yearly to incoming graduate students. Over the course of a week, we cover topics from 7th grade algebra through college calculus and introductory statistics. We review mathematical rules, do applied practical examples, and introduce tricks in statistical derivations that students will see in their first year coursework. In addition to a review of important concepts, I also aim to give students a safe space to review materials, ask questions, and develop relationships. Over the years, I have also added coding components (introduction to R, visualizing spatial data in R, mechanics of statistical tests.)
