Hello, my name is Sean Reid! I am currently a third year graduate student in the Department of Geography at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research interests are broadly in urban and population dynamics and how they are influenced by climate change, natural disasters, health hazards, and conflict.

When I'm not sitting behind a computer working, I enjoy a wide range of outdoor activities. I love to push myself, whether it be climbing mountains with a pack on my back or running ultra marathons. My recent move to Santa Barbara encouraged me to pick up surfing and I am HOOKED. I'm absolutely terrible but I'm getting there!

Please browse around my site to learn more about what I'm up to in personal and professional life!
